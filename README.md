# Project Summary

There are several cases here in Queensland with the fact that the patient is left waiting to see a specialist for months. One of the cases is how Danielle Nicholas waited for eight months to be told that she had cancer. This news is from Brisbane Times by Lucy Stone on June 2018 which means the news is recent and not yet solved. Referrals are very important to be noticed especially in the remote areas where people had difficulty to conduct consultation with the specialist. They have to travel in certain distant and make an appointment for a consultation. There are many reasons that cause this results, and one of the many is the fact that the referral system is still unstructured and unorganized. This issue has concerned our team, thus, we chose this issue as our domain problem.

As we have done our research more deeply, we've found insight regarding the referral system that Queensland has at the moment. The detailed research could be found in this design process link, [Research for Easy Referral](https://github.com/deco3500-2018/Pirates-of-Design/wiki/3.-Research-for-Easy-Referral). After all the user testing and research from different kinds of literature and published documents, we have concluded our project features as follows:

1. GP
   * **Create referral.** Creating referral is divided into 3 steps, which are to choose range of dates based on the patient preference, choose the nearest physician based on both GP and patient preference, and create referral detail based on patient information and patient illness at the moment.
   * **Choose nearest physicians.** Choosing the nearest physician could be adjusted based on the patient preference of address.
   * **See Referral History.** Seeing all referral and patient history that the GP has made. GP also could see the status of the referral.
   * **Chat with a physician.** By having a platform to communicate, GP could address the problem with the assigned physician easier. It's also more straightforward and a smooth process to keep track of any communication history. Each referral has its own chat platform.

2. Physician
   * **Approve referral.** By approving referral, it means that the physician is agreeing to the following date that GP and patient choose earlier. The approving referral also makes certainty for the patient regarding having the consultation with the physician. 
   * **Set schedule.** By setting a schedule, when GP create the referral, the system will know whether or not the physician is available at the range of dates. However, the system won't put the detail. The website only will display the available physicians.
   * **See detailed referral.** Referral detail page is very important for a physician in order to know the referral description and patient history. 
   * **Chat with GP.** By having a platform to communicate, Physician could address the problem with the assigned GP easier. It's also more straightforward and a smooth process to keep track of any communication history. Each referral has its own chat platform.

3. Patient
   * **Have an appointment from referral.** By having an appointment with the referral, the date and time are set where it guarantees the appointment schedule for the patient.
   * **See referral detail and updates.** By having updates, the patient is informed if any changes with the referral are made. 
   * **Change appointment DateTime.** By having a feature to change appointment DateTime, the patient could be more flexible in making free time in order to see the physician.
   * **Get notified when the time is near.** Having notification on reminding the event will be helpful for the patient and decrease the possibility of late appointment.
